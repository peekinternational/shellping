    <h3>Parent/sibling/friend of Member Signup</h3>
    <p>As a parent/sibling/friend of the member of the group but not the person that runs it you have two options:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-greek">
        <li>
            <strong>**RECOMMENDED**</strong> Create your group on Shelping.COM. This involves you putting up the groups
            name and a brief description so it's not a lot of work. Once you have created your group and your account
            you are provided with a special link that you can send to the person who actually runs your group. That
            person can then create their own account on Shelping.COM and take ownership of your group. The point of you
            creating the group first is that it gives you more to share to the other members and also you and the other
            members and their friends and families can immediately start helping the group through changing brand to
            Shelping.COM. To start by creating your group click <a ng-click="setStep(1)">click here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Just create your account on Shelping.COM and not worry about creating the group yet as you can add a group
            at any time. Once you have your Shelping.COM account, share Shelping.COM on your social media and let the
            person who runs the group know to come and create the group on Shelping.COM. Once the group is created you
            and all the other members and their friends and families can select it to be the group you support by
            changing your brand to Shelping.COM. In the meantime you can still go ahead and buy Shleping.COM products or
            create Shelping.COM subscriptions that you can build up credit from meaning as soon as your group is created
            by the person who runs it you already have credit you can give to support your group. To go ahead and join
            Shelping.COM <a ng-click="setStep(2)">click here</a>.
