                                    Think about all the people that you and the directly linked households above can reach by simply sharing your project on Faceboook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn etc. Sharing your project will reach a lot of people. It could literally be 100s if not 1000s if your project is good enough and appeals to enough people.
